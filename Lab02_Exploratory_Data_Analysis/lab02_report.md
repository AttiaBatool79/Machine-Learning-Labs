# Lab 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the process of exploring and understanding a dataset. It involves looking at the data, finding patterns, and using graphs to summarize the information. EDA helps us prepare the data for further analysis or machine learning.

## Why is EDA Important?

EDA is important because:
- It helps us understand what the data contains.
- It shows errors, missing values, or outliers.
- It reveals relationships between variables (e.g., age and survival).
- It helps us decide which features to use for predictions.

---# Titanic Dataset Analysis

This lab is about exploring the Titanic dataset to understand the data better and find useful patterns. It helps to know who survived, how age or ticket class affected survival, and other insights.

## Tools Used

We use the following Python libraries:
1. **pandas**: To manage and analyze the data.
2. **numpy**: To do calculations with numbers.
3. **matplotlib**: To make simple graphs.
4. **seaborn**: To make beautiful and detailed graphs.

## Steps to Follow

1. **Load the Dataset**: Read the Titanic dataset using Python.
2. **Look at the Data**: See the first few rows, column names, and missing values.
3. **Analyze Columns**:
   - Check individual columns like Age, Fare, and Pclass.
   - Use graphs like histograms and boxplots.
4. **Find Relationships**:
   - See how variables are connected (e.g., Age and Survival).
   - Use scatterplots, heatmaps, and pairplots.

## Example Graphs

- **Boxplot**: Shows outliers and spread of data.
- **Histogram**: Shows how data is distributed.
- **Heatmap**: Shows how two variables are related.
