## Objective

The goals of this lab are to:

1. Apply classification techniques to predict employee attrition.  
2. Compare Logistic Regression and Random Forest models.  
3. Understand the importance of data preprocessing and evaluation metrics.

## Introduction

This lab addresses a real-world HR problem: predicting if an employee is likely to leave the organization. Understanding employee attrition is essential for companies to improve retention strategies, cut hiring costs, and maintain team morale. Using machine learning, we will analyze patterns in HR data and make predictive decisions.

## Dataset Overview

Dataset: **HR Employee Attrition Data**

The dataset contains various details about employees, such as their job roles, demographic data, and salary. The target variable is **Attrition**â€”whether an employee left or stayed.

| Column Name         | Description                                      |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Age                 | Age of the employee                              |
| JobRole             | Employee's job role                              |
| MaritalStatus       | Marital status of employee                       |
| MonthlyIncome       | Monthly salary                                   |
| Attrition           | Target (Yes/No for leaving the company)         |
| ...                 | Other HR and demographic features                |

## Python Libraries

Youâ€™ll need the following Python libraries to perform the classification tasks:

- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis  
- `numpy`: For numerical operations  
- `matplotlib` & `seaborn`: For data visualization  
- `scikit-learn`: For implementing ML models and preprocessing  
- `joblib`: For saving the trained model

## Steps for Classification

### 1. Load the Dataset

Start by loading the dataset into a pandas DataFrame. This helps you explore the structure, check for missing values, and understand feature distributions.

### 2. Data Preprocessing

This involves cleaning the data:  
- Handling missing values  
- Encoding categorical variables using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding  
- Dropping irrelevant features  
This step ensures the model only receives useful, clean input.

### 3. Feature Scaling

Since ML models can be sensitive to the scale of data, numerical features are standardized (usually using StandardScaler) so that they have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

### 4. Train-Test Split

Divide the dataset into a training set (used to train the model) and a test set (used to evaluate its performance). A common split ratio is 70:30 or 80:20.

### 5. Logistic Regression

Train a Logistic Regression modelâ€”a simple and interpretable linear model suitable for binary classification. It estimates probabilities and classifies employees as likely to leave or stay.

### 6. Random Forest Classifier

Train a Random Forest modelâ€”a more advanced, ensemble-based method that builds multiple decision trees and combines their outputs for better accuracy and robustness.

### 7. Model Evaluation

Evaluate both models using metrics like:  
- Accuracy  
- Precision  
- Recall  
- F1 Score  
- Confusion Matrix  
This comparison helps choose the better model for the HR department.

### 8. Model Saving

Save the final model using `joblib` so that it can be reused later without retraining.

## Deliverables

- Well-commented Jupyter notebook
- Comparison of Logistic Regression vs Random Forest  
- Final saved model file (.pkl or .joblib)

---

## Beginner Tips

- Visualize relationships in the dataset using graphs  
- Use fewer features initially to test the model quickly  
- Donâ€™t worry if the accuracy is lowâ€”focus on learning  
- Try tweaking parameters (like number of estimators in Random Forest)  
- Always cross-check results using multiple evaluation metrics
