## Lab 01: Basics of Python and File Handling
In Lab 01, we focus on:
- **Studying Basic Python** concepts such as variables, loops, functions, and data types.
- **Working with Files**:
  - Handling CSV files for data storage and analysis.
  - Reading and writing JSON files for structured data exchange.
- **Setting Up Jupyter Notebooks in VSCode** to create and run Python code interactively.

All resources and practical implementations for Lab 01 are available in the `Lab01` folder.

## Lab 02: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
In Lab 02, we perform an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to:
- Understand the dataset structure and features.
- Perform **Univariate Analysis** to study individual variables.
- Conduct **Bivariate Analysis** to explore relationships between variables.
- Use **Multivariate Analysis** to identify patterns involving multiple variables.
- Visualize the data effectively using various graphs and extract meaningful insights.

All resources and practical implementations for Lab 02 are available in the `Lab02` folder.

## Lab 03: Linear Regression with One Variable
In Lab 03, we implement simple linear regression to:
- Understand the relationship between one independent variable and the dependent variable.
- Train a linear model to predict outcomes based on historical data.
- Evaluate model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²).
- Visualize regression results with scatter plots and trend lines.

All resources and practical implementations for Lab 03 are available in the `Lab03` folder.

## Lab 04: Linear Regression with Multiple Variables
In Lab 04, we extend linear regression to multiple independent variables:
- Understand how multiple factors influence the dependent variable.
- Train a multiple linear regression model and interpret coefficients.
- Evaluate model performance with MSE and R².
- Use residual plots to check model assumptions.

All resources and practical implementations for Lab 04 are available in the `Lab04` folder.
