## Lab 01: Basics of Python and File Handling
In Lab 01, we focus on:
- **Studying Basic Python** concepts such as variables, loops, functions, and data types.
- **Working with Files**:
  - Handling CSV files for data storage and analysis.
  - Reading and writing JSON files for structured data exchange.
- **Setting Up Jupyter Notebooks in VSCode** to create and run Python code interactively.

All resources and practical implementations for Lab 01 are available in the `Lab01` folder.

## Lab 02: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
In Lab 02, we perform an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to:
- Understand the dataset structure and features.
- Perform **Univariate Analysis** to study individual variables.
- Conduct **Bivariate Analysis** to explore relationships between variables.
- Use **Multivariate Analysis** to identify patterns involving multiple variables.
- Visualize the data effectively using various graphs and extract meaningful insights.

All resources and practical implementations for Lab 02 are available in the `Lab02` folder.
