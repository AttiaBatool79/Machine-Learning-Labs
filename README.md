## Lab 01: Basics of Python and File Handling
In Lab 01, we focus on:
- **Studying Basic Python** concepts such as variables, loops, functions, and data types.
- **Working with Files**:
  - Handling CSV files for data storage and analysis.
  - Reading and writing JSON files for structured data exchange.
- **Setting Up Jupyter Notebooks in VSCode** to create and run Python code interactively.

All resources and practical implementations for Lab 01 are available in the `Lab01` folder.

## Lab 02: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
In Lab 02, we perform an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to:
- Understand the dataset structure and features.
- Perform **Univariate Analysis** to study individual variables.
- Conduct **Bivariate Analysis** to explore relationships between variables.
- Use **Multivariate Analysis** to identify patterns involving multiple variables.
- Visualize the data effectively using various graphs and extract meaningful insights.

All resources and practical implementations for Lab 02 are available in the `Lab02` folder.

## Lab 03: Linear Regression with One Variable
In Lab 03, we implement simple linear regression to:
- Understand the relationship between one independent variable and the dependent variable.
- Train a linear model to predict outcomes based on historical data.
- Evaluate model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²).
- Visualize regression results with scatter plots and trend lines.

All resources and practical implementations for Lab 03 are available in the `Lab03` folder.

---

## Lab 04: Linear Regression with Multiple Variables
In Lab 04, we extend linear regression to multiple independent variables:
- Understand how multiple factors influence the dependent variable.
- Train a multiple linear regression model and interpret coefficients.
- Evaluate model performance with MSE and R².
- Use residual plots to check model assumptions.

All resources and practical implementations for Lab 04 are available in the `Lab04` folder.

---

## Lab 05: Regularization in Linear Regression
In Lab 05, we explore **Regularization techniques** such as Ridge (L2) and Lasso (L1) regression:
- Understand the problem of overfitting in linear models.
- Implement **Ridge Regression** to reduce model complexity by penalizing large coefficients.
- Apply **Lasso Regression**, which can also perform feature selection by shrinking some coefficients to zero.
- Compare the performance of standard Linear Regression, Ridge, and Lasso models.

All resources and practical implementations for Lab 05 are available in the `Lab05` folder.

---

## Lab 06: Polynomial Regression
In Lab 06, we implement **Polynomial Regression**, an extension of linear regression that models non-linear relationships:
- Understand how Polynomial Regression works.
- Train and compare **Linear vs. Polynomial Regression models**.
- Visualize how different polynomial degrees affect model performance.
- Evaluate the model using error metrics and predictions.

All resources and practical implementations for Lab 06 are available in the `Lab06` folder.
