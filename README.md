# Machine-Learning-Labs

This repository contains Machine Learning lab manuals, reports, and practical implementations from the 6th semester. It serves as a resource for understanding key ML concepts and algorithms.

## Lab 01: Basics of Python and File Handling
In Lab 01, we focus on:
- **Studying Basic Python** concepts such as variables, loops, functions, and data types.
